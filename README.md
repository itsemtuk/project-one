Project Title:  Forget Me Not
Team members :   Adam, Ben, Tabbi.

Breif description with user story:
    Who is your audience?   Houseplant owners
    What is the problem the product will address?   Missing watering times leading to over or under watering plants.
    How does the product solve that problem?   Allows the user to add a list of their plants, with images.  Allows the user to create a schedule of when to water their plants.  Plants image background changes colour depending on how close it is to needing to be watered. (green - good first 50%      orange - becoming due - last 30% of time    red - due day/ anytime past)


Api 1:   Plant information  (e.g ideal temperature)

Api 2 :   Weather ( to know what adjustments to make to reach the plant's ideal temperature.)     Would be nice to see if there is one that has a weather forecast.


Things needed on the webpage:
    Searchbox to find plant.
    image list of owned plants - to see their background change.
    cards with plants in and then tells you when to water it and plants ideal plant temp with the weather next to it.

(added feature) have user able to choose if it is an indoor or outdoor plant. (for an outdoor plant if it is cold outside it could say bring this plant inside e.t.c)
